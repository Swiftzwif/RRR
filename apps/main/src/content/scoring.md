# Trajectory Assessment Scoring Framework

## Scale
**1–5 Scale:**
- 1 = Never / Very Low
- 2 = Rarely  
- 3 = Sometimes
- 4 = Often
- 5 = Always / Excellent

## Domain Scoring
**Domain score = arithmetic mean of items in that domain**

## Domain Labels
- 🔴 **1.0–3.1** → *Unacceptable (Noise / Downward Spiral)*
- 🟡 **3.2–4.1** → *Acceptable (Floor / Stagnation Risk)*  
- 🟢 **4.2–5.0** → *Desirable (Signal / Upward Trajectory)*

## Avatar Mapping (Overall Score)
**Overall score = arithmetic mean of all domain scores**

### 🔴 Drifter (Consumer Mode: 1.0–3.1)
"You're letting the noise steer your life. But awareness is your first win. You now see the game you're playing — and you can choose a different one."

### 🟡 Balancer (Transitional: 3.2–4.1) 
"You're walking the line between average and excellent. You've begun raising the floor, but there's still noise keeping you stuck. The next level requires intentional systems."

### 🟢 Architect (Creator Mode: 4.2–5.0)
"You're building your life by design. You've raised your floor high, and you're moving on an upward trajectory. Now it's about mastery, consistency, and playing long games."

## Domain-Specific Labels

### 🧭 Identity & Direction
- 🔴 Lost (Noise) 
- 🟡 Drifting (Floor) 
- 🟢 Architect (Signal)

### ⚡ Health & Energy  
- 🔴 Drained (Noise) 
- 🟡 Surviving (Floor) 
- 🟢 Energized (Signal)

### 💰 Finances
- 🔴 Vulnerable (Noise) 
- 🟡 Stable (Floor) 
- 🟢 Secure (Signal)

### 🤝 Relationships
- 🔴 Isolated (Noise) 
- 🟡 Neutral (Floor) 
- 🟢 Supported (Signal)

### 🌊 Emotions & State
- 🔴 Reactive (Noise) 
- 🟡 Unsteady (Floor) 
- 🟢 Calm (Signal)

### 🎯 Focus & Attention
- 🔴 Scattered (Noise) 
- 🟡 Distracted (Floor) 
- 🟢 Laser-Focused (Signal)

## Tie-Breaking Order for Lowest Domains
When identifying the lowest two domains for recommendations, tie-break in this order:
1. identity
2. health  
3. finances
4. relationships
5. emotions
6. focus

## Ethos
**"Kill the boy so the man may rise."**

The assessment framework references the **Rethink • Redesign • Reignite** methodology for transformation.
