## Storytelling Framework

### The Transformation Arc
Every story must follow the proven transformation pattern:

```typescript
// Story structure template
export const STORY_STRUCTURE = {
  setup: {
    purpose: 'Establish the current state and problem',
    elements: [
      'Where the person is now (SlowLane/SideLane)',
      'What\'s not working in their current approach',
      'The pain of staying the same',
      'The cost of inaction'
    ],
    example: 'Meet John, a 28-year-old marketing manager who\'s stuck in the SlowLane...'
  },
  
  conflict: {
    purpose: 'Create tension and urgency for change',
    elements: [
      'The moment of realization',
      'The struggle to change',
      'Obstacles and setbacks',
      'The choice to transform or stay stuck'
    ],
    example: 'John realized he was trading time for money in a system designed to keep him dependent...'
  },
  
  transformation: {
    purpose: 'Show the process of change and growth',
    elements: [
      'The decision to Kill the Boy',
      'Learning new frameworks and mindsets',
      'Taking action and building systems',
      'Overcoming obstacles and failures'
    ],
    example: 'John started studying successful entrepreneurs and began building his own business...'
  },
  
  resolution: {
    purpose: 'Demonstrate the new reality and possibilities',
    elements: [
      'The new state of being',
      'Measurable results and outcomes',
