# Marketing Language & Positioning

## Core Messaging Framework

### FastLane/SideLane/SlowLane Positioning
Every piece of content must clearly position users within the three-lane framework:

```typescript
// Lane definitions and messaging
export const LANE_MESSAGING = {
  fastlane: {
    name: 'FastLane',
    description: 'High-leverage, scalable wealth building through business ownership',
    characteristics: ['Scalable', 'High-leverage', 'Asset-building', 'Time-freedom'],
    messaging: 'Build systems that work while you sleep',
    target: 'Ambitious entrepreneurs ready to scale'
  },
  sidelane: {
    name: 'SideLane',
    description: 'Traditional employment with strategic optimization and side hustles',
    characteristics: ['Stable', 'Optimized', 'Diversified', 'Gradual growth'],
    messaging: 'Optimize your current path while building alternatives',
    target: 'Career professionals seeking growth'
  },
  slowlane: {
    name: 'SlowLane',
    description: 'Conventional career path with incremental advancement',
    characteristics: ['Traditional', 'Secure', 'Predictable', 'Limited upside'],
    messaging: 'Safe but limited growth potential',
    target: 'Risk-averse individuals in traditional careers'
  }
};
```
