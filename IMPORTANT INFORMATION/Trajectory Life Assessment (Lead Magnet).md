### **✨ The Story: *Kill the Boy***

When I turned 25, my mentor told me something I’ll never forget:

**“Kill the boy.”**

It wasn’t about violence. It was about transformation.

It meant letting go of the parts of me that kept me small, reactive, average — so I could rise into discipline, presence, and responsibility.

* The **boy** settles. The **man** insists.

* The **boy** tolerates mediocrity. The **man** demands excellence.

* The **boy** complains. The **man** is silent, steady, grounded.

* The **boy** explains himself. The **man** doesn’t need to — his presence speaks.

* The **boy** reacts, pulled like a puppet. The **man** observes, cuts the strings, and chooses his response.

* The **boy** rushes. The **man** moves with intention.

* The **boy** asks: *“What can the world offer me?”*

* The **man** asks: *“What can I offer the world?”*

To kill the **boy** is not to reject your youth, but to lay it to rest — the **man** decided to put away childish things — so **he** can rise.

#  **Bridge to 1:1 Coaching**

**Copy:**  
 “Some of you won’t stop at the Guide. You’ll want personal guidance — someone to walk with you step by step.

This work isn’t for everyone — and it can’t be. To protect the depth and integrity of the experience, I only accept **250 private coaching clients per year**.

Why? Because transformation takes presence. If I tried to work with everyone, I’d dilute the very thing that makes this process powerful.

That’s why there’s a gateway: the **Interview Process**.  
 It’s not a sales call. It’s a fit test — for both of us.

Your $24.99 investment shows me you’re serious. In return, I’ll invest back into you with a surprise gift in our first encounter.

The interview is where we’ll find out if this is the right time, the right path, and the right partnership. If it is, you’ll unlock access to **1:1 Trajectory Coaching**: four 45-minute sessions ($100 each), where together we master your inner world, redesign your systems, and anchor your new trajectory.”
