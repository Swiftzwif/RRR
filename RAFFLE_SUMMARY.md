# Kill The Boy Raffle Implementation Summary

## What We've Created

I've transformed the raffle plan into a comprehensive Claude-ready implementation guide that aligns with all our skills and the transformation mission.

### Key Enhancements

1. **Skill Integration**
   - Every phase references specific skills from `.claude/skills/`
   - Clear guidance on which patterns to apply
   - Focus on transformation, not just functionality

2. **Autonomous Execution**
   - Step-by-step Claude actions for each phase
   - Exact file locations and folder structures
   - Atomic commit messages pre-written

3. **Implementation Timeline**
   - 4-day structured approach
   - Day 1: Foundation (DB + Homepage button)
   - Day 2: Core Experience (Landing + Payment)
   - Day 3: Excellence (Webhook + Admin)
   - Day 4: Testing & Launch

4. **Quality Standards**
   - Apple-grade UI requirements
   - Life-transforming UX patterns
   - Performance targets (page load <2s)
   - Zero console errors mandate

5. **Transformation Focus**
   - Copy examples that inspire vs deflate
   - Commitment rituals built into UX
   - Social proof through live warrior count
   - Prizes positioned as transformation tools

### Files Created/Updated

1. **`kill-the-boy-raffle-enhanced.plan.md`** - Complete implementation guide
2. **Database schema** - Ready for migration
3. **Component structure** - All components outlined
4. **API patterns** - Payment flow bulletproofed

### Next Steps

Claude can now autonomously implement the entire raffle feature by:
1. Following the step-by-step guide
2. Applying the referenced skills
3. Maintaining transformation focus
4. Delivering Apple-grade quality

The plan ensures every element serves the mission: helping men kill the boy and become the architect of their lives.

## Quick Start for Claude

```bash
# Start implementation
git checkout develop && git pull
git checkout -b feat/raffle-grand-opening

# Then follow kill-the-boy-raffle-enhanced.plan.md

Remember: This isn't just a raffle. It's the catalyst for transformation.
